For the database storage use any server like wampserver
Save the folder named "hms" in wamp64/www/ if you are using wamp server in windows.

Later go to PHPMyAdmin of the localhost and open index.php using the file location on your browser.
http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php

Go to import and select the file hmsdb.sql from the folder.
Now as the database and tables are ready type
http://localhost/hms/
